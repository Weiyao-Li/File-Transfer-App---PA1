Detailed Instructions and Output Samples!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER SIDE:
1. open terminal 1
2. python main.py -s 5000

CLIENT SIDE:
Here we have our 3 client: Dave, Alice and Bob ->

python main.py -c Dave 127.0.0.1 5000 5008 5009
python main.py -c Alice 127.0.0.1 5000 5004 5005
python main.py -c Bob 127.0.0.1 5000 5002 5003

For this:
"Enter command (setdir/offer/table/help/list/request/dereg/disconnect):"

using the following command would satisfy the project requirement:

setdir: set directory
offer: offer files
table: display local table
list: list files
request: request files
dereg: de-registration
disconnect: exit

REGISTRATION SECTION

    OUTPUT: you should see successful registration, local table initialized (you can also use table command to see it)

2. Server retries sending the table of offered files a maximum of 2 times when the client ack is not received within 500ms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE OFFERING SECTION

PLEASE NOTE that I have created 2 test folder in my Desktop, named as "testdir" and "testdir222"
"testdir" folder is for the -> file offerer Dave
"testdir222" folder is for the -> file requester Alice

PLEASE NOTE that you must have test files in your test folder, so that you can offer files
Here I have test3.pdf, btest2.py and atest1.py in my "testdir" folder

Now Dave would like to offer 3 files:

1. go to terminal 2, where you registered Dave
2. setdir /Users/weiyaoli/Desktop/testdir
3. offer test3.pdf btest2.py atest1.py (NOTE: if you would like to offer a single file, it will work)
4. you can see the success msg now

Exceptions:
1. it will work as stated in the specification
2. given an invalid directory, the client program doesnâ€™t crash and an appropriate error message is printed
3. offer command should fail with an appropriate error message if no setdir command has succeeded

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE LISTING SECTION

1. use command "list", so that you can see all offered files by all parties
2. proper message when no files are being offered
3. file updated when client table updated

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE TRANSFER SECTION

PLEASE NOTE THAT in terminal 3 Alice the requester, you need to set receiving directory first!

1. set up receiving directory: setdir /Users/weiyaoli/Desktop/testdir222
2. Alice wants to request test3.pdf: request test3.pdf Dave
3. you should see the success msg (including original size and received size, they must match demonstrating no content loss happened)
4. check your local testdir222 folder. You should see test3.pdf in this folder

- Appropriate status messages will be printed at critical points of the file transfer, similar to the example provided in the specification
- An appropriate error message should be printed when the client tries to request a non-existent file or a file from an incorrect client
